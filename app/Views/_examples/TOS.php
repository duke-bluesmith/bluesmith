<h2>Terms of Service</h2>

<h3>Services</h3>
<section>
	<p>
		Our staff will work diligently to complete your print job in a timely manner.
		Printer and material availability, job complexity, and priority work all contribute
		to possible delays in service so we cannot guarantee a delivery time. However we
		will communicate regularly and offer additional status updates upon request.
	</p>
	<p>
		3D printing is an experimental technology that often fails. Equipment failures are
		not unusual. Our staff will make every attempt to print your object successfully.
		If equipment breaks or the print failed without cause we will attempt to print it
		again. The likelihood of failure increases significantly with more difficult-to-print
		models. If the failure is a result of simply submitting too difficult of a model,
		customers will still be charged an attempt fee of half the price of the initial
		quote. Users can accept the failed job or we can make a second attempt at the print;
		in this scenario, we will make additional attempts at 50% of the original estimate.
	</p>

<h3>Pricing</h3>
<section>
	<p>
		Print charges are estimated based on the material they will use and the time it
		takes for staff to process them. Actual costs of completed jobs may vary from
		from the issued estimate, and you are responsible for final cost within a reasonable
		amount increase.
	</p>
	<p>
		The cost of 3D printing varies widely and is based on the technology and amount of 
		material used. Material prices are liable to change frequently and thus our printing
		costs may also change without notice for new jobs.
